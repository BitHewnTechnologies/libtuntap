libtuntap 0.4-beta
==================

Description
-----------

libtuntap is a library for configuring TUN or TAP devices in a portable manner.

TUN and TAP are virtual networking devices which allow userland applications
to receive packets sent to it. The userland applications can also send their
own packets to the devices and they will be forwarded to the kernel.

This is useful for developping tunnels, private networks or virtualisation
systems.

Supported Features
------------------

   * Creation of TUN _and_ TAP devices;
   * Autodetection of available TUN or TAP devices;
   * Setting and getting the MAC address of the device;
   * Setting and getting the MTU of the device;
   * Setting the status of the device (up/down);
   * Setting the IPv4 address and netmask of the device;
   * Setting the persistence mode of the device;
   * Setting the name of the device (Linux only);
   * Setting the description of the device (OpenBSD and FreeBSD only);
   * Python and C++ bindings;

Building libtuntap
------------------

libtuntap builds cleanly without any external libraries. The only other
dependency is CMake (2.6 or +) and, of course, a C compiler.

On most systems you can build the library using these commands:

   * mkdir build && cd build
   * cmake ..
   * make

There is three options for the CMakeLists.txt, all desactivated by default:

   * `ENABLE_REGRESS`: include the regression tests
      * Needs CMake 2.8
   * `ENABLE_CXX`: include the C++ bindings
      * Needs a C++ 11 compiler
   * `ENABLE_PYTHON`: include the Python bindings, it also activates ENABLE_CXX
      * Needs a C++ 11 compiler
      * Needs boost-python

Supported Systems
-----------------

   * OpenBSD
   * Linux
   * NetBSD
   * Darwin

Current Porting Efforts (in listed order)
-----------------------------------------

   * Solaris
   * Windows
   * FreeBSD

In the future
